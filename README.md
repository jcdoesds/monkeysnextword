# Monkeys Next Word

A shiny app that guesses the next word. 

After trimming features to ensure this could fit in a shiny app, it is not very good for complex sentences, but it does okay with simple and common structures.

The working application shows up to 10 possible next words with an estimate of how likely those are the word the user was meaning. It also uses cartoon monkeys to make it more fun, and it has an Easter egg.
